  title: GA4GH __biosample__
  description: |
    In this schema, a "biosample" as the source of the material of a molecular analysis (e.g. genomic array, sequencing), represents the main “biological item” against which molecular variants are referenced.
  version: '2018-09-12'
definitions:
  Biosample:
    properties:
      id:
        type: string
        description: The local-unique identifier of this biosample (referenced as "biosample_id").
        example: 'AM_BS__NCBISKYCGH-1993'
      individual_id:
        type: string
        description: |
          In a complete data model "individual_id" points to the "id" of the individual ("donor") this <i>biosample</i> was derived from.
          In a local context this could be the <code>id</code> attribute in a corresponding "individuals" collection.
        example: 'ind-cnhl-1293347-004'
      description:
        type: string
        description: A free text description of the biosample.
        example: 'Burkitt lymphoma, cell line Namalwa'
      age_at_collection:
        type: string
        description: the age of the individual at time of biosample collection, as ISO8601 string
        example: 'P56Y'
      age_at_collection_class:
        schema:
          $ref: './common/Ontology_class'
        description: the age of the individual at time of biosample collection, as ontology object
        example:
          id : "HP:0003621"
          label : "Juvenile onset"
      biocharacteristics:
        description: |
          "biocharacteristics" represents a wrapper list of "biocharacteristic_class" objects with properly prefixed term ids, describing features of the biosample.
          Examples would be phenotypes, disease codes or other ontology classes specific to this biosample. In a complete data model (variants - (callsets) - biosamples - individuals), characteristics applying to the individual (e.g. sex, most phenotypes) should be annotated there.
        type: array
        items:
          $ref: './common/Biocharacteristic_class'
        example:
          - description: "Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma"
            class :
              id : "pgx:icdot:c25.9"
              label : "Pancreas, NOS"
          - description : "Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma"
            class:
              id : "pgx:icdom:81403"
              label : "Adenocarcinoma, NOS"
          - description : "Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma"
            class :
              id : "ncit:c8294"
              label : "Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma"
        queries:
          - query: 'db.biosamples.find( { "biocharacteristics.class.id" : "pgx:icdom:81403" } )'
            description: |
              The query will return all biosamples with an (exact) class.id of "pgx:icdom:81403" in their "biocharacteristics" object list.
          - query: 'db.biosamples.distinct( { "biocharacteristics.class.id", "biocharacteristics.class.id" : { $regex : /ncit/ } } )'
            description: |
              This call to the distinct funcion will return *all* bioterms ids for samples having some ncit id; to retrive only the ncit ids, this has to be followed by a regex filter (/^ncit/).
      external_ids:
        description: list of reference_class objects with properly (e.g. identifiers.org) prefixed external identifiers and a term describing the relationship
        type: array
        items:
          $ref: './common/Reference_class'
        example:
          - id : "cellosaurus:CVCL_0312"
            relation : "provenance"
          - id : "pubmed:17440070"
            relation : "report"
          - id : "geo:GPL4894"
            relation : "technology"
          - id : "geo:GSM185088"
            relation : "denotes"
        queries:
          - query: 'db.biosamples.find( { "external_ids.id" : "pubmed:17440070" } )'
            description: the query will return all biosamples reported in this publication
      geo_provenance:
        description: |
          This geo_class attribute ideally describes the geographic location of where the sample was extracted.
          Frequently this value may reflect either the place of the laboratory where the analysis was performed, or correspond to the corresponding author's institution.
        schema:
          $ref: './common/Geo_class'
        example:
          label: 'Str Marasesti 5, 300077 Timisoara, Romania'
          city: 'Timisoara'
          country: 'Romania'
          latitude: 45.75
          longitude: 21.23
          altitude: 94

        example:
          followup_time:
            type: ISO8601 string
            value: 'P14M'
          death:
            type: boolean
            value: true
        queries:
          - description: |
              This query retrieves biosamples with an ISO8601 period value for "followup_time" and a boolean "true" for death.
            query: 'db.biosamples.find( {"info" : { $elemMatch: { "followup_time.value" : { $regex : /\P/ }, "death.value" : true } } } )'

        description: time of the last edit of this record, in ISO8601
