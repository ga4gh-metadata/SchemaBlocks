  title: GA4GH __biosample__
  description: |
    In this schema, a "biosample" as the source of the material of a molecular analysis (e.g. genomic array, sequencing), represents the main “biological item” against which molecular variants are referenced.
  version: '2018-09-12'
definitions:
  Biosample:
    properties:
      id:
        type: string
        description: The local-unique identifier of this biosample (referenced as "biosample_id").
        example: 'AM_BS__NCBISKYCGH-1993'
      project_id:
        type: string
        description: |
          The id attribute of the project that this biosample was collected in.
        example: 'ind-cnhl-1293347-004'
      individual_id:
        type: string
        description: |
          In a complete data model "individual_id" points to the "id" of the individual ("donor") this <i>biosample</i> was derived from.
          In a local context this could be the <code>id</code> attribute in a corresponding "individuals" collection.
        example: 'ind-cnhl-1293347-004'
      name:
        type: string
        description: |
          A short descriptive name for sample which should be sufficient to distinguish it from other samples in the project or collection.
        example: 'Sample BRCA-00429, 2nd replicate'
      description:
        type: string
        description: A free text description of the biosample.
        example: 'Burkitt lymphoma, cell line Namalwa'
      data_use_conditions:
        schema:
          $ref: './common/Ontology_class'
        description: |
          Data use conditions applying to data from this biosample, as ontology object (e.g. DUO).
        example:
          id : "DUO:0000004"
          label : "no restriction"
      age_at_collection:
        schema:
          $ref: './common/Age_class'
        description: |
          The age of the individual at time of biosample collection, as Age_class object.
        example: 
          age: 'P56Y'
          age_class:
            id : "HP:0003621"
            label : "Juvenile onset"
      biocharacteristics:
        description: |
          "biocharacteristics" represents a wrapper list of "biocharacteristic_class" objects with properly prefixed term ids, describing features of the biosample.
          Examples would be phenotypes, disease codes or other ontology classes specific to this biosample. In a complete data model (variants - (callsets) - biosamples - individuals), characteristics applying to the individual (e.g. sex, most phenotypes) should be annotated there.
        type: array
        items:
          $ref: './common/Biocharacteristic_class'
        example:
          - description: "Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma"
            class :
              id : "pgx:icdot:c25.9"
              label : "Pancreas, NOS"
          - description : "Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma"
            class:
              id : "pgx:icdom:81403"
              label : "Adenocarcinoma, NOS"
          - description : "Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma"
            class :
              id : "ncit:c8294"
              label : "Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma"
        queries:
          - query: 'db.biosamples.find( { "biocharacteristics.class.id" : "pgx:icdom:81403" } )'
            description: |
              The query will return all biosamples with an (exact) class.id of "pgx:icdom:81403" in their "biocharacteristics" object list.
          - query: 'db.biosamples.distinct( { "biocharacteristics.class.id", "biocharacteristics.class.id" : { $regex : /ncit/ } } )'
            description: |
              This call to the distinct funcion will return *all* bioterms ids for samples having some ncit id; to retrive only the ncit ids, this has to be followed by a regex filter (/^ncit/).
      external_ids:
        description: list of reference_class objects with properly (e.g. identifiers.org) prefixed external identifiers and a term describing the relationship
        type: array
        items:
          $ref: './common/Reference_class'
        example:
          - id : "cellosaurus:CVCL_0312"
            relation : "provenance"
          - id : "pubmed:17440070"
            relation : "report"
          - id : "geo:GPL4894"
            relation : "technology"
          - id : "geo:GSM185088"
            relation : "denotes"
        queries:
          - query: 'db.biosamples.find( { "external_ids.id" : "pubmed:17440070" } )'
            description: the query will return all biosamples reported in this publication
      geo_provenance:
        description: |
          This geo_class attribute ideally describes the geographic location of where the sample was extracted.
          Frequently this value may reflect either the place of the laboratory where the analysis was performed, or correspond to the corresponding author's institution.
        schema:
          $ref: './common/Geo_class'
        example:
          label: 'Str Marasesti 5, 300077 Timisoara, Romania'
          city: 'Timisoara'
          country: 'Romania'
          latitude: 45.75
          longitude: 21.23
          altitude: 94

          This is a wrapper for objects without further specification in the schema.

          death:
            type: boolean
            value: true
        queries:
          - description: |
              This query retrieves biosamples with an ISO8601 period value for "followup_time" and a boolean "true" for death.
            query: 'db.biosamples.find( {"info" : { $elemMatch: { "followup_time.value" : { $regex : /\P/ }, "death.value" : true } } } )'
      created:
