  title: GA4GH __callset__
  description: |
    The callset object contains information about an experiment performed on material from a single biosample and is a shared identifier for all variants detected in this experiment, attributed to the referenced biosample.

              The cnv_maps object is a wrapper for genomic interval mapped status information. In Progenetix and arrayMap, this is used to indictate - for fixed 1MB genome intervals - the status (dup_map => "DUP" or "", del_map => "DEL" or ""), or the maximum / minimum positive / negative value encountered in the segment, as far as it has been called to contain DUP or DEL.
              With a standard binning of 1MB, the arrays would contain ~3000 values each (depending on genome edition).
