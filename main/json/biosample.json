      "description" : "In this schema, a \"biosample\" as the source of the material of a molecular analysis (e.g. genomic array, sequencing), represents the main “biological item” against which molecular variants are referenced.\nPXF:  See https://github.com/ga4gh-metadata/metadata-schemas/blob/d4ca1b4b36a5e7b3a17db79da9ae03a2114cfcaf/schemas/biometadata.proto#L84-L138 A Biosample refers to a unit of biological material from which the substrate molecules (e.g. genomic DNA, RNA, proteins) for molecular analyses (e.g. sequencing, array hybridisation, mass-spectrometry) are extracted. Examples would be a tissue biopsy, a single cell from a culture for single cell genome sequencing or a protein fraction from a gradient centrifugation. Several instances (e.g. technical replicates) or types of experiments (e.g. genomic array as well as RNA-seq experiments) may refer to the same Biosample.
