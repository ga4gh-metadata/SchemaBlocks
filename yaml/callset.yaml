description: |
  The callset object contains information about an experiment performed on material from a single biosample and is a shared identifier for all variants detected in this experiment, attributed to the referenced biosample. 
attributes:
  - name: _id
    description: the database-internal object id
    example: ObjectId("558e5c56ad9a82d958392bd6")

  - name: id
    description: The local-unique identifier of this callset (referenced as "callset_id").
    type: string
    example: 'GSM264198'

  - name: biosample_id
    description: The identifier ("biosample.id") of the biosample this variant was reported from. This is a shortcut to using the variant -> callset -> biosample chaining.
    example: 'pgx-bs-987647'

  - name: description
    description: A free text description of the callset.
    type: string
    example: 'SNP6 array of cancer sample BRCA-0893'

  - name: geo_provenance
    description: |
      This geo_class attribute ideally describes the geographic location of where this callset was analysed.
    type: geo_class object
    example:
      - label: 'Str Marasesti 5, 300077 Timisoara, Romania'
        city: 'Timisoara'
        country: 'Romania'
        latitude: 45.75
        longitude: 21.23

        description: |
          The cnv_maps object is a wrapper for genomic interval mapped status information. In Progenetix and arrayMap, this is used to indictate - for fixed 1MB genome intervals - the status (dup_map => "DUP" or "", del_map => "DEL" or ""), or the maximum / minimum positive / negative value encountered in the segment, as far as it has been called to contain DUP or DEL.
          With a standard binning of 1MB, the arrays would contain ~3000 values each (depending on genome edition).
        value:
          dup_map:
          type: array
          value: 
            ["", "", "DUP", "DUP", "DUP", "", "", "", "", "", ""]          
      binning:
        type: int64

          interval size in bases for the binning, when creating the cnv_maps
