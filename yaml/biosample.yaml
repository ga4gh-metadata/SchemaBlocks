name: biosample
description: |
  In this schema, a "biosample" as the source of the material of a molecular analysis (e.g. genomic array, sequencing), represents the main “biological item” against which molecular variants are referenced.
updated: '2018-09-07'
attributes:
  - name: _id
    description: the database-internal object id
    example: ObjectId("558e5c56ad9a82d958392bd6")

  - name: id
    description: The local-unique identifier of this biosample (referenced as "biosample_id").
    type: string
    example: 'AM_BS__NCBISKYCGH-1993'

  - name: individual_id
    description: |
      In a complete data model "individual_id" represents the identifier of this biosample in the "individuals" collection.
    type: string
    example: 'ind-cnhl-1293347-004'

  - name: description
    description: A free text description of the biosample.
    type: string
    example: 'Burkitt lymphoma, cell line Namalwa'

  - name: age_at_collection
    description: the age of the individual at time of biosample collection, as ISO8601 string
    example: 'P56Y'

  - name: age_at_collection_class
    description: the age of the individual at time of biosample collection, as ontology object
    type: common.ontology_class
    example:
      id : "HP:0003621"
      label : "Juvenile onset"

  - name: biocharacteristics
    description: |
      "biocharacteristics" represents a wrapper list of "biocharacteristic_class" objects with properly prefixed term ids, describing features of the biosample.
      Examples would be phenotypes, disease codes or other ontology classes specific to this biosample. In a complete data model (variants - (callsets) - biosamples - individuals), characteristics applying to the individual (e.g. sex, most phenotypes) should be annotated there.
    type: list
    example:
      - description: "Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma"
        class :
          id : "pgx:icdot:c25.9"
          label : "Pancreas, NOS"
      - description : "Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma"
        class:
          id : "pgx:icdom:81403"
          label : "Adenocarcinoma, NOS"
      - description : "Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma"
        class :
          id : "ncit:c8294"
          label : "Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma"
    queries:
      - query: 'db.biosamples.find( { "biocharacteristics.class.id" : "pgx:icdom:81403" } )'
        description: |
          The query will return all biosamples with an (exact) class.id of "pgx:icdom:81403" in their "biocharacteristics" object list.
      - query: 'db.biosamples.distinct( { "biocharacteristics.class.id", "biocharacteristics.class.id" : { $regex : /ncit/ } } )'
        description: |
          This call to the distinct funcion will return *all* bioterms ids for samples having some ncit id; to retrive only the ncit ids, this has to be followed by a regex filter (/^ncit/).

  - name: external_ids
    description: list of reference_class objects with properly (e.g. identifiers.org) prefixed external identifiers and a term describing the relationship
    type: list of reference_class objects
    example:
      - id : "cellosaurus:CVCL_0312"
        relation : "provenance"
      - id : "pubmed:17440070"
        relation : "report"
      - id : "geo:GPL4894"
        relation : "technology"
      - id : "geo:GSM185088"
        relation : "denotes"
    queries:
      - query: 'db.biosamples.find( { "external_ids.id" : "pubmed:17440070" } )'
        description: the query will return all biosamples reported in this publication

  - name: geo_provenance
    description: |
      This geo_class attribute ideally describes the geographic location of where the sample was extracted.
      Frequently this value may reflect either the place of the laboratory where the analysis was performed, or correspond to the corresponding author's institution.
    type: geo_class object
    example:
      label: 'Str Marasesti 5, 300077 Timisoara, Romania'
      city: 'Timisoara'
      country: 'Romania'
      latitude: 45.75
      longitude: 21.23
      altitude: 94

  - name: info
    description: |
      This is a wrapper for objects without further specification in the schema.
    type: common.info_class objects
    queries:
      - description: |
          This query retrieves biosamples with an ISO8601 period value for "followup_time" and a boolean "true" for death.
        query: 'db.biosamples.find( {"info" : { $elemMatch: { $elemMatch: { "name" : "followup_time", "value" : { $regex : /\P/ } }, $elemMatch: { "name" : "death", "value" : true } } } } )'
    example:
        followup_time:
          type: ISO8601 string
          value: 'P14M'
        death:
          type: boolean
          value: true

  - name: updated
    description: time of the last edit of this record, in ISO8601
    type: ISO8601 string
    example: '2017-10-25T07:06:03Z'
